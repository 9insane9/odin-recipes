    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy recipe for healthy banana oatmeal pancakes. These flourless banana oat pancakes are fluffy and naturally sweet. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium bananas, ripe</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free rolled oats</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup 
            (You can substitute with sugar, coconut sugar, honey, or your favorite sweetener. 
            Or you can leave it out to be naturally sweetened by the bananas. )</li>
        <li>½ cup milk (You can substitute with your favorite dairy-free milk. )</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all of the ingredients to a blender or food processor. Blend on high until completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Let the batter rest for 5 minutes. This allows the oats to soften and the batter to thicken.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or skillet to medium heat. Once warmed, grease with cooking spray, oil, or butter. I use gluten-free coconut cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter into a greased ¼ cup measuring cup and pour the batter onto the greased griddle or skillet. Cook the pancakes for 2-3 minutes. 
            Once the pancakes puff up and start to lightly bubble, flip the pancakes and cook for another 2-3 minutes. 
            If you find that pancakes are browning too quickly, lower the heat. If your griddle starts smoking, it means your pan is too hot.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining pancake batter adding a little more cooking oil or butter to the pan between batches as needed.</li>
        <li>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
