    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy gluten-free waffle recipe with a dairy-free and Vegan option. 
        A gluten-free waffle mix made with a few simple ingredients that make fluffy, soft in the inside, and crispy waffles every time! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (Vegan option use gluten-free Bob's Red Mill egg replacer)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose gluten-free flour (I like Pillsbury gluten-free flour. 
            Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. You may experience different baking results depending on the gluten-free flour blend you choose.)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon xanthan gum ((leave out if your flour blend already has it))</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons gluten-free baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cup milk (dairy-free/Vegan use unsweetened almond, cashew, or coconut milk)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl whisk the eggs (or egg replacer), granulated sugar, pure vanilla extract, and the vegetable oil together.</li>
        <li>Add the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (leave out if your flour already has it), gluten-free baking powder, and salt to the 
            egg mixture and mix until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in milk and mix until smooth. </li>
        <li>Using a greased ice cream scoop, pour the batter onto a preheated greased waffle machine.</li>
        <li>Cook the waffles according to the directions of the waffle maker, or until they are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Top with butter, syrup or favorite topping. Enjoy! Store leftovers in an air-tight container.</li>
        <li>These waffles can be frozen and reheated in the microwave. To freeze the waffles, allow them to completely 
            cool and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet and flash freeze them for 10 minutes. Flash freezing 
            them keeps them from sticking together. Once they are flash frozen, you can remove them from the baking sheet
             and place them inside a freezer-safe bag or air-tight container.</li>
    </ol>
